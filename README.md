## User Story 
As an employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications, I want to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples so that I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

Additionally, the Resume section will include a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer's proficiencies.
