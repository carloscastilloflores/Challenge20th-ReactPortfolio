            Hi there! My name is Carlos Castillo Flores, and I'm a designer and photographer based in Guadalajara, 
            Mexico. I studied industrial design and have been applying my knowledge to create systems, products, 
            and visuals for the last 5 years. As a professional photographer, I've had the opportunity to work with 
            different brands to help them translate their vision to reality through stunning visuals that are both 
            creative and effective.

            Lately, I've been diving into the world of web development and applying my design abilities to create
            beautiful and functional websites. I'm excited to continue learning and growing in this field, and I'm
            always looking for new projects to work on. If you're interested in collaborating on a project or have
            an idea you'd like to discuss, please feel free to connect with me! I'm always open to new opportunities
            and would love to hear from you.
            </p>
